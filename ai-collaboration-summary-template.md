# AI collaboration summary

**Student name:** Moriah Guretse

**Assignment:** Week 2 - Use Agent mode

**Expected time:** About 15 minutes to complete this reflection

## Key interactions

Review your chat history with Agent and document 2 meaningful interactions—ones where you learned something new or had to adjust your prompt.

### Interaction 1: [package.json respository syntax]

**My prompt:**

> Why does the repository link have git+ before the link?

**What happened:**

Agent explained that the "git+" prefix tells npm that it is a Git repository and specifies the protocol for accessing it. I learned that it is used to ensure npm recognizes it as a valid Git URL.

### Interaction 2: [package.json explanation]

**My prompt:**

> @workspace /explain 

**What happened:**

Agent explained what the package.json file is and how it tells everything npm needs to know about the JavaScript project. It then explained the purpose of each field within the file along with an example and why it matters. This helped me learn how each field within the package.json file functions to be able to use myself.

## Documentation you created

### docs/tutorial-package-json.md

This file explains in detail what each field in the package.json file means, why it matters, and what happens if it's missing. The fields include name, version, description, main, directories, scripts, repository, keywords, author, license, type, bugs, homepage, and dependencies. I partially edited Agent's output due to some weird grammar that did not make sense with the context being read by a beginner. It explained everything well in a beginner-friendly way, but was written directed at me rather than a general audience.

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

### Agent mode for setup (required)

Using Agent to set up npm rather than myself helped automate and account for other things that I might of not been aware of. The downside is, is that you have to pay extra attention to what commands and changes Agent is specifically making because it can be easy to blindly trust it, which can lead to issues created by Agent.

### What you learned (required)

The most useful thing I learned was Agent's ability to automate setup and tasks that would usually take me much more time to complete.
